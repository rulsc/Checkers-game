# Checkers-game

Coding a checkers game in HTML/CSS/JavaScript is something I've wanted to do for a while. I thought I couldn't legitimately call myself a frontend developer until I could pull it off. Well, after three weeks I've done it! Sort of. If you check my CodePen, you'll see I attempted it years ago but couldn't get it done. Now, I've improved to the point where this is possible. It isn't using anything special except basic object-oriented programming. It's a little messy now, but I'll continue to refine it. I also plan to add simple AI to play against. This isn't an official release. It's only a demo and skills showcase. Oh yeah, American rules, so jumps are mandatory. Appreciate any feedback! Let me know if you run into a bug. If you're developer, feel free to download, extend or modify but please just attribute me.
