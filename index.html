    <h3>Checkers Rules</h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers">
      <p>
        Only dark squares are used. A piece can only move diagonally into an
        unoccupied square. When capturing an opponent's piece is possible,
        <em>capturing is mandatory</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A man moves one step diagonally forwards and captures an adjacent
        opponent's piece by jumping over it and landing on the next square.
        Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is
        done by successive jumps made by a single piece; the jumps do not need
        to be in the same line and may zigzag. In American checkers, men can
        jump only forwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a man reaches the farthest row forward, it becomes a king. It is
        marked by crowning.
        <em
          >The king has additional powers, including the ability to move and
          capture backwards</em
        >. Like a man, a king can make successive jumps in a single turn,
        provided each jump captures an enemy piece.
      </p>
